# macos-rdp-server

A lightweight RDP server daemon for macOS Tahoe and later. Connect to your Mac from any standard RDP client — Windows Remote Desktop, FreeRDP, Remmina — with the same smoothness you'd expect from a Windows environment.

## Features

- **H.264 hardware encoding** via VideoToolbox — low latency, low CPU
- **Your own screen, or a screen of its own** — by default the session shows and controls the Mac's main display, as Screen Sharing does; `RDP_DISPLAY_MODE=virtual` gives each session a dedicated CGVirtualDisplay instead, leaving your physical screen undisturbed (a Mac with no display lit always gets one)
- **Full keyboard & mouse injection** via CGEventPost with a complete RDP scan-code table — JIS/ISO/ANSI aware, IME keys, Unicode input
- **Bidirectional clipboard** — text and images sync between client and host
- **System audio redirection** — hear your Mac's audio through the RDP client
- **Structured logging** — four levels (ERROR / INFO / VERBOSE / DEBUG), set via flag or env var
- **DriverKit HID extension** *(optional, requires Apple Developer account)* — injects input at the HID stack level, works at the login window and in secure input fields
- **launchd integration** — auto-starts at boot, restarts on crash
- **TLS encryption** — self-signed certificate generated on install; clients trust on first connect
- **Follows the client's window** — display control (MS-RDPEDISP) resizes the virtual display, the stream and the GFX surface live; a client at 150 % scale or more (a Mac's Retina 200 %) gets a **HiDPI** virtual display, so text is rendered at the client's density. On the main display, a client that resizes gets the stream in the display's own shape, at Retina pixels for such a client
- **Mac-to-Mac extensions (MACRDPX)** — a Mac client that joins the `MACRDPX` channel sends keys as Mac keys with exact modifiers (⌘ stays ⌘, Fn, left/right), the pointer with real click counts, pixel-precise trackpad scrolling with momentum, and can choose the frame rate and bit rate mid-session. See [docs/MAC-CLIENTS.md](docs/MAC-CLIENTS.md). Every other client is plain RDP, unchanged

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Homebrew (only needed when building from source; pre-built binaries have no runtime dependencies)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (source builds only)

## One-line install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Screen capture requires the daemon to run in your GUI (Aqua) login session.** The
> system LaunchDaemon installed by the commands in this section has no WindowServer
> connection and will render a **black screen**. For a working, durable setup — one that
> also keeps the Screen Recording / Accessibility permission valid across updates — use
> the per-user installer instead, after obtaining the binary:
>
> ```bash
> scripts/install-user.sh /usr/local/sbin/macos-rdp-daemon   # or any path to the binary
> ```
>
> It runs the daemon as a per-user LaunchAgent (Aqua session → WindowServer → capture
> works) and signs it with a stable self-signed certificate, so macOS pins the permission
> grant to the signature rather than the cdhash that changes on every rebuild. No sudo.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grioghar/macos-rdp-server/master/scripts/remote-install.sh | sudo bash
```

Downloads the latest pre-built **universal binary** (a single file that runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon) from GitHub Releases. No Homebrew, no compilation, no runtime dependencies — the binary links only against macOS system frameworks.

The script will:
1. Download the universal binary to `/usr/local/sbin/macos-rdp-daemon`
2. Generate a self-signed TLS certificate at `/etc/macos-rdp/`
3. Install and load the launchd service on port 3389
4. Print your IP address and the two Privacy permission steps required

Or download the binary directly:
```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://github.com/grioghar/macos-rdp-server/releases/latest/download/macos-rdp-daemon \
  -o /usr/local/sbin/macos-rdp-daemon && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/macos-rdp-daemon
```

Verify the download against the published checksum:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/grioghar/macos-rdp-server/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS | shasum -c
```

After installation, open any RDP client and connect to your Mac's IP address.

> **Reproducible builds.** Release binaries are built entirely from source-pinned forks
> (FreeRDP and OpenSSL), statically linked, in a single CI pass. Nothing is pulled from a
> package manager at build or run time. See [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Manual install

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
brew install freerdp cmake openssl pkgconf

# 2. Clone (with the macrdpx submodule)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/grioghar/macos-rdp-server.git
cd macos-rdp-server
# an existing checkout: git submodule update --init

# 3. Build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix freerdp);$(brew --prefix openssl)"
cmake --build build

# 4. Install as a per-user LaunchAgent (no sudo; see the note above)
scripts/install-user.sh build/macos-rdp-daemon
```

`install-user.sh` turns the self-updater off by default (`RDP_UPDATE_ENABLED=0`)
because it would replace your build with the upstream release. Settings such as
`RDP_LOG_LEVEL`, `RDP_KEYBOARD_TYPE` or `RDP_SWAP_CTRL_CMD` can be passed in the
environment when running it. Japanese / JIS keyboard notes: [docs/JAPANESE-SETUP.md](docs/JAPANESE-SETUP.md).

## Connect

| Client | Steps |
|---|---|
| Windows Remote Desktop | Start → `mstsc` → enter your Mac's IP |
| macOS Remote Desktop | App Store → Microsoft Remote Desktop → Add PC |
| FreeRDP (CLI) | `xfreerdp /v:your-mac-ip /u:$(whoami) /cert:ignore` |
| Remmina | New connection → protocol RDP → enter IP |

On first connect your client will show a certificate trust prompt — accept it. Subsequent connections skip this.

## Privacy permissions

macOS gates the daemon's capabilities behind Privacy & Security:

| Permission | Required for |
|---|---|
| Screen Recording | `CGDisplayStream` frame capture |
| Accessibility | `CGEventPost` keyboard & mouse injection |
| Microphone | CoreAudio system audio tap |

The installer opens the relevant panes automatically. To (re)run the helper:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grioghar/macos-rdp-server/master/scripts/grant-permissions.sh | sudo bash
```

What it does:
- **SIP enabled** (default): opens the **Screen Recording** and **Accessibility** panes. Click **+ → Cmd-Shift-G → `/usr/local/sbin`**, select `macos-rdp-daemon`, and toggle it on. (Once an RDP client has connected once, the binary registers itself in these lists, so you can just flip the switch.)
- **SIP disabled**: grants both permissions directly by writing the system TCC database, then restarts the daemon — no clicking.

> macOS does not allow any tool to grant Screen Recording / Accessibility programmatically while SIP is on — that restriction is the whole point of TCC. The helper makes the manual step as close to one click as the OS permits. Fully unattended granting requires [disabling SIP](docs/no-signing.md).

After enabling both, restart the service:
```bash
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.macosrdp.daemon
```

## Configuration

### Port

Edit `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macosrdp.daemon.plist`:

```bash
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macosrdp.daemon.plist
# set --port <n> in ProgramArguments
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macosrdp.daemon.plist
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port` | `3389` | TCP port to listen on |
| `--log-level` | `info` | Log verbosity (see below) |

Stream and display settings, as environment variables of the LaunchAgent:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RDP_MAX_FPS` | `30` | Frame-rate cap (1–120); a MACRDPX client may change it per session |
| `RDP_BITRATE_KBPS` | `8000` | H.264 target bit rate; likewise per session for MACRDPX clients |
| `RDP_DISPLAY_MODE` | `main` | `main` shows the Mac's main display; `virtual` gives each session a display of its own, sized to the client |
| `RDP_HIDPI` | auto | `auto`: HiDPI virtual display at a client scale ≥ 150 %; `0` never; `1` always |
| `RDP_DISP` | on | `0` disables display control (the desktop keeps its connect-time size) |
| `RDP_MACRDPX` | on | `0` disables the Mac-to-Mac extensions channel |
| `RDP_CURSOR_SHAPES` | auto | `1` streams real cursor shapes to every client; `0` never. MACRDPX clients get them by default |

## Logging

The daemon uses a four-level structured logger. Each log line includes a timestamp, level tag, and subsystem component:

```
[14:23:01.042] [INFO ] [server] listening for RDP connections on port 3389
[14:23:04.187] [INFO ] [main  ] client connected from ::ffff:192.168.1.5
[14:23:04.201] [INFO ] [peer  ] peer activated: 1920x1080 @32bpp
[14:23:04.203] [INFO ] [session] setting up display 1920x1080 for ::ffff:192.168.1.5
[14:23:04.251] [INFO ] [display] virtual display created: displayID=3 1920x1080
[14:23:04.260] [INFO ] [encoder] H.264 encoder ready: 1920x1080 @ 8000 kbps
[14:23:04.261] [INFO ] [capture] capture started on displayID=3
[14:23:04.265] [INFO ] [audio  ] audio capture started on device 48
[14:23:04.266] [INFO ] [session] session active for ::ffff:192.168.1.5
```

### Log levels

| Level | What it logs | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `error` | Hard failures that stop a session or the daemon | Production; quiet machines |
| `info` | Connection lifecycle — connect, activate, disconnect | Default |
| `verbose` | Subsystem events — channel opens, display creation, encoder start, audio start | Diagnosing connection or feature issues |
| `debug` | Per-frame and per-event detail — every keypress, every encoded frame size, every dirty rect | Deep protocol troubleshooting |

> **Warning:** `debug` logs every captured frame and input event. At 60fps this is ~3,600 lines/minute. Use it for short captures only.

### Setting the log level

**CLI flag** (one-off / manual runs):
```bash
sudo macos-rdp-daemon --log-level verbose
sudo macos-rdp-daemon --log-level debug
```

**Environment variable** (persists across restarts):
```bash
# Live, without editing the plist:
sudo launchctl setenv RDP_LOG_LEVEL verbose
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.macosrdp.daemon

# Or set it permanently in the launchd plist:
# /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macosrdp.daemon.plist
# → EnvironmentVariables → RDP_LOG_LEVEL
```

### Reading logs

```bash
# Follow the daemon log file directly:
tail -f /var/log/macos-rdp-daemon.error.log

# Filter by level:
tail -f /var/log/macos-rdp-daemon.error.log | grep '\[ERROR\]'

# Via macOS unified logging (also shows os_log entries):
log stream --predicate 'process == "macos-rdp-daemon"' --level debug

# Historical logs in Console.app:
# Filter by process name "macos-rdp-daemon"
```

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo bash scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Optional DriverKit HID extension (requires Apple Developer account):
injects keyboard/mouse at the HID level — works at login window
```

## Without an Apple Developer account

The daemon runs fully without code signing. You only need a Developer account for the optional DriverKit HID extension. See [Running without signing](docs/no-signing.md).
