# macOS RDP Server — Feature & Stability Test Plan

Goal: parity with the Windows Remote Desktop (mstsc) experience, and rock-solid stability.

Status legend: ✅ working · ⚠️ partial / needs work · ❌ not implemented · ❓ untested

Test client: Windows `mstsc` → macOS Tahoe 26 arm64. Server build auto-updates from master CI.

### Known issues / in progress
1. **Drive mounting needs hardware test** — WebDAV bridge is built; test by connecting mstsc with Drives enabled.
2. **Image clipboard** — PNG support is wired (0xC004), but needs verification against real mstsc.
3. **Stability soak** — §10 scenarios not run yet.
4. **Multi-monitor per-display** — span mode works (one big virtual display); per-display virtual displays not built.
5. **Printer/USB redirection** — out of scope for personal use.
6. **Upstream FreeRDP PRs** — 1 PERF + 2 MEDIUM fixes ready to file (commands in docs/security-audit-2026-06-02.md).
